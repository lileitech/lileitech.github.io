## Biography

Lei Li is a Lecturer (*equals to* Assistant Professor) at the School of Electronics & Computer Science, [University of Southampton](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/about/faculties-schools-departments/school-of-electronics-and-computer-science). She received her PhD degree from the School of Biomedical Engineering, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021 and obtained the *SJTU 2021 Outstanding Doctoral Graduate Development Scholarship*. During her PhD, she was a visiting PhD student at [Fudan University](https://zmiclab.github.io/) and [King’s College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/bmeis/our-departments/biomedical-engineering), respectively. She received her bachelor’s degree in Department of Medical Information Engineering, [Sichuan University](https://eie.scu.edu.cn/ceeiten/index.htm), in 2016.

Her research interest is AI for healthcare, specifically focusing on medical image analysis, multi-modal AI, and cardiac digital twins. She has already published more than 40 papers in peer-reviewed journals and international conferences, including MedIA, IEEE TMI, MICCAI and FIMH. Some of these works have been selected as the most popular cited paper in MedIA and TMI. She is a Board Member of SIG-Cardiac and Women in MICCAI (WiM), and Area Chair of MICCAI 2024. She has been selected as the *Rising Star of Women in Engineering* by Asian Deans' Forum 2023 and Featured Women in Science by RSIP Vision. She has co-organized five MICCAI challenge events, including CARE 2024, LAScarQS 2022, MyoPS 2020, MS-CMRSeg 2019, and MM-WHS 2017. She serves as a reviewer for many journals and conferences, including MedIA, IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TMI, IEEE TBME, Neurocomputing, Information Fusion, Neural Networks, ISBI, IPMI, MIDL, and MICCAI, etc.
