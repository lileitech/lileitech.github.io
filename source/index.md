## Biography

Lei Li is a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, [University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/). She received her PhD degree from the School of Biomedical Engineering, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021 and obtained the SJTU 2021 Outstanding Doctoral Graduate Development Scholarship. During her PhD, she was a visiting PhD student at Fudan University and King’s College London, respectively. She received her bachelor’s degree in Department of Medical Information Engineering, Sichuan University, in 2016.

Her research interest is artificial intelligence based medical image analysis for healthcare. Specifically, she is focusing on developing novel computational algorithms for cardiac image computing, multi-modality image computing, and cardiac digital twins. She has already published more than 30 papers in peer-reviewed journals and interregnal conferences, including MedIA, IEEE TMI, and MICCAI. Some of these works have been selected as the most popular cited paper in MedIA and TMI. She is a Board member of Women in MICCAI (WiM) and Editorial Board Member of the Journal of Medical Artificial Intelligence. She has been co-organizer of four MICCAI challenge events, including LAScarQS 2022, MyoPS 2020, MS-CMRSeg 2019, and MM-WHS 2017. She is a reviewer for many journals and conferences, including MedIA, IEEE TPAMI, IEEE TMI, IEEE TBME, Neural Networks, Neurocomputing, ISBI, IPMI, MIDL, and MICCAI, and obtained IEEE TMI Distinguished Reviewer (2020-2022).
