## Biography

Lei Li is a Postdoctoral Research Assistant at the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, [University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/). She obtained her PhD degree from the School of Biomedical Engineering, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/) in 2021. During her PhD, she was a visiting PhD student at Fudan University and King’s College London, respectively. She obtained the SJTU 2021 Outstanding Doctoral Graduate Development Scholarship. Her research interest is at the interface between machine learning and medical imaging, including developing novel computational methods for medical image analysis as well as translating the methods to clinical research and healthcare. She has already published more than 30 papers in peer-reviewed journals and interregnal conferences, including MedIA, IEEE TMI, and MICCAI. Some of these works have been selected as the most popular cited paper in MedIA. She is now one of the Board Members of Women in MICCAI (WiM) and an Editorial Board Member of the Journal of Medical Artificial Intelligence. She has been co-organizer of four MICCAI challenge events, including LAScarQS 2022, MyoPS 2020, MS-CMRSeg 2019, and MM-WHS 2017.
