## Biography

Lei Li is a post-doc in the Institute of Biomedical Engineering (IBME) at [University of Oxford](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/biomedical-image-analysis/). She obtained her PhD degree from School of Biomedical Engineering, [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.bme.sjtu.edu.cn/), supervised by [Professor Xiahai Zhuang](http://www.sdspeople.fudan.edu.cn/zhuangxiahai/).  During her PhD, she was a visiting PhD student of Fudan University and King's College London, respectively. Her PhD thesis is ["Left Atrial Scar Segmentation and Quantification from Late Gadolinium Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Images"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18T8i1J-tptPSHxcsVsCE_J6kfDVJizHS/view?usp=sharing). She has published 5 peer-reviewed journal papers and 5 conference paper of that she first-authored or is corresponding author. Some of the papers were published in the highly impacted journal or conference, including five in Medical Image Analysis and two in MICCAI. Her research interest includes left atrial image computing, multi-modality cardiac image segmentation and registration, and patient-specific cardiac modelling and simulation.
